Use this template as a starting point for any Swift 3 module that you want other people to include in their projects.

**STATUS: This template is ready to work in production code.**

## Features
Your new Swift 3 module will immediately have working, compilable code, and all these features:

-   Ability to be used from Swift Package Manager, CocoaPods and Carthage
-   Clean folder structure
-   MIT license
-   Testing as a standard
-   Turnkey access to Travis CI
-   Semantic versioning and a CHANGELOG

## How to Use This

Clone or [download a release](https://github.com/fulldecent/swift-package/releases) and run the  `./configure` program. It will ask you some questions and generate a project.

You then add all the interesting features you want your module to have.

## Contributing

See the file [`Recipe.md`](Recipe.md) for the complete steps (e.g. Open Xcode, make new project, click here, type that, ...) of how we made the template.
